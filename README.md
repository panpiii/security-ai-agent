A lightweight **DevSecOps command-line tool** that orchestrates open-source security scanners and uses AI (planned) to summarize findings into human-readable risk reports.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Security AI Agent** helps developers and DevOps engineers quickly identify vulnerabilities in their Python projects.

It runs well-known security scanners such as:
- 🧩 [`pip-audit`](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) — dependency vulnerability scanning  
- 🧱 *(Coming soon)* `Bandit` — static code analysis for insecure coding patterns  
- 🤖 *(Planned)* LLM summarizer — converts raw scan data into readable Markdown or JSON with remediation tips  

### 💡 Why this project
Modern teams ship fast, but often skip security checks until deployment.  
This tool automates early detection by integrating lightweight scans into your **local workflow** or **CI/CD pipeline**, keeping your dependencies and code secure from the start.
